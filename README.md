Simplified payment processing system. Backend services are written in golang and will contain authentication using jwt, a transaction processing system meant to represent online payment flows, a merchant accounting system representing the offline flows like settlement and merchant risk, an authentication service using jwt and eventually downstream payment processor mocks.

## ðŸ’» Pre-requisites
The authorization service uses EdDSA keys for JWT signing. To create those keys use the following commands, on OpenSSL :

openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out test-priv.pem
openssl pkey -in test-priv.pem -pubout -out test-pub.pem

## â˜• Running the system
TBA
